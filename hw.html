    <h2><u>School Days:</u></h2>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> School life</b> is often a whirlwind of experiences, filled with friendships, lessons, and unforgettable memories.
        The days start early, <i>with sleepy students rushing to make it to class on time</i>, while the school bell rings
        through the halls. <mark>From lively classroom discussions to the occasional group project, each day brings new
            opportunities to learn and grow</mark>. Lunchtime is a favorite, with students gathering in groups, sharing stories,
        and planning their next adventure. After school, some rush off to sports practice, while others gather for clubs
        or study sessions. Amidst the laughter, challenges, and occasional stress of exams, <b>school life</b> leaves behind a
        treasure trove of moments that shape personalities and last a lifetime.</p>

    <h2><u>College Days</u></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>College life</b> is a dynamic and transformative phase filled with independence, exploration, and growth. It’s a time
        when students leave behind the structured routine of school and step into a world of new opportunities and
        responsibilities. <i>From balancing academics with extracurricular activities to late-night study sessions and
            spontaneous adventures with friends, <b>college life</b> is as challenging as it is exciting.</i> Lectures and projects
        demand focus, but the freedom to choose courses and explore interests allows for personal and intellectual
        growth. Campus events, clubs, and social gatherings create a vibrant community where lifelong friendships are
        forged. <mark>It’s a journey of self-discovery, learning to manage time, pursue passions, and prepare for the future,
            all while making memories that last a lifetime</mark>.</p>
